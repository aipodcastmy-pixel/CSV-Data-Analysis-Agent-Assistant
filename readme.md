# üß† CSV Data Analysis AI Assistant

An intelligent, private, web-based AI assistant that automates CSV data analysis. Upload a `.csv` file and let the agent auto-read, understand, and generate multiple aggregated views, interactive charts, and business intelligence-style reports ‚Äî all locally in your browser for maximum privacy.

This advanced tool allows users to have a conversation with their data, asking for specific analyses, getting summaries, and even directing the AI to manipulate the UI to better highlight insights.
