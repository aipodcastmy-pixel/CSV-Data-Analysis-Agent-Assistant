# üß† CSV Data Analysis Agent

An intelligent, private, web-based AI assistant that automates CSV data analysis. Upload a `.csv` file and let the agent auto-read, understand, and generate multiple aggregated views, interactive charts, and business intelligence-style reports ‚Äî all locally in your browser for maximum privacy.

This advanced tool allows users to have a conversation with their data, asking for specific analyses, getting summaries, and even directing the AI to manipulate the UI to better highlight insights.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Local First & Private**: All CSV processing and data aggregation happens directly in your browser. Your data never leaves your computer unless you enable Cloud AI.
*   **Persistent Session History**: Your work is always safe. The app continuously saves your current analysis to a "live session". If you reload the page, you'll be right back where you left off. When you upload a new file, your previous session is automatically archived to the History panel.
*   **AI-Powered Data Preparation**: The assistant acts as a data engineer. It intelligently analyzes your raw CSV for complex structures, summary rows, or other anomalies. It then writes and executes a custom JavaScript function on-the-fly to clean and reshape your data into a tidy, analysis-ready format.
*   **Configurable AI Settings**:
    *   Securely use your own Google Gemini API key.
    *   Switch between `gemini-2.5-flash` (fast) and `gemini-2.5-pro` (powerful).
    *   Choose the agent's response language.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis Generation**: On file upload, the AI assistant proactively generates a set of diverse and insightful analysis plans and visualizes them as cards.
*   **Interactive & Customizable Charts**:
    *   Switch between Bar, Line, and Pie charts on-the-fly for any analysis.
    *   **Top N Filtering**: Focus on what matters. For charts with many categories, you can instantly filter to see the "Top 5", "Top 10", or "Top 20" items, with all others grouped into an "Others" category.
    *   Zoom and pan on charts to explore dense data.
    *   Click on data points to see details and multi-select for comparison.
*   **Conversational AI Chat**: Engage in a dialogue with the AI. Ask for new analyses, inquire about data points, or request summaries. The AI maintains conversation context.
*   **ü§ñ "Point and Talk" Interaction**: The AI now has deep context of the on-screen charts, including their underlying data. It can perform a sequence of actions to guide you, creating a more natural conversational flow. For example, it can first highlight a relevant chart and then follow up with a detailed text explanation in the chat, effectively 'pointing' at what it's discussing. It can:
    *   **Highlight Cards**: Asks the AI to "highlight the card showing sales by region" and it will scroll to it and add a visual highlight.
    *   **Change Visualizations**: Tell the AI to "change the monthly users chart to a line graph".
    *   **Show Raw Data**: Ask to "show me the data for the top products card".
*   **Comprehensive Export Options**: Export any analysis card as a PNG image, a CSV file of the aggregated data, or a full HTML report.
*   **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern interface that works seamlessly on different screen sizes, with a resizable and collapsible assistant panel.
